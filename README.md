# hello-world
jr first foray into exploring github
slightly confused but getting there
still confused cant seem to edit my
hello.py file
ok managed that but not sure how i did it
I want to start another project to contain
my Python User Guide but need to understand 
more how this whole thing works.
The only way to do this is to keep using it!

that worked by pressing the big commit button below
